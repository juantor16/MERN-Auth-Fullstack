# MERN-Auth-Fullstack

This is a project where I have learned about MERN and created a simple login and sign up form with frontend, backend, database, and JWT for security. The project has been a valuable learning experience, enabling me to understand and apply full-stack development concepts.

## Getting Started

To get this project running locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB account and database set up

### Installation

#### Client Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `client` directory:
   
  `git clone git@github.com:juantor16/MERN-Auth-Fullstack.git`
  
  `cd client`
  
2. Install dependencies:

  `npm install`

3. Start the development server:

  `npm run dev`

The client will be running on `http://localhost:5173/`.

#### Server Setup
1. Navigate to the `server` directory from the root:
   
   `cd server`

2. Install dependencies:

   `npm install`
   
4. Create a `.env` file using `example.env` as a template. Add your MongoDB connection string to the `MONGO_URL` variable.

5. Start the server:

  `npm start`
